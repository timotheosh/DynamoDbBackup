# DynamoDbBackup
This is a Java project, using Maven, that embeds Jython and Python scripts in order to generate Hive scripts for backing up AWS DynamoDb tables to AWS S3 storage.

This is still alpha for now. It is a real project at work, and thus our company's bitbucket repo will have priority, but I will update this with non-company sensitive info as I go along.

The ability to package one's own Python scripts and have them run in Jython all in a single jar has been completed. No unit tests have been defined.
